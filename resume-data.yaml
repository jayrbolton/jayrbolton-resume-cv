      - KBase enables bench scientists to analyze research data and run bioinformatics workflows interactively. I work on core backend services in Python and Go, such as graph database APIs and the search engine. I also help to expand and document the bioinformatics SDK for third-party developers.
      - In 2019, I received a lab recognition award for my work on the Relation Engine, which creates and queries large networks of biological data. I also regularly use high performance computing at NERSC to run large-scale genome sequence analysis.
