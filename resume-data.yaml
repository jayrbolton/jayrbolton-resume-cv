    title: Software Engineer, KBase (Lawrence Berkeley Lab)

      - I work alongside a team of scientists and engineers enabling active
        research on complex genomic data gathered in the biology lab. Using
        Python and Go, I wrote and maintain KBase's graph database API and search
        engine, which helps users expand their knowledge of basic genomic data.
      - I received a lab recognition award for my work on the Relation Engine.
        Powered by a graph database, it aggregates, queries, and clusters large
        networks of biological data.

        small team of engineers and running most business operations. We
        graduated from the BoostVC startup accelerator, received funding
        from Mark Cuban and Tim Draper, and became profitable, processing over
        $25 million in payments on behalf of nonprofits.
      - Our small team built a wide range of well-received nonprofit
        fundraising tools using Ruby on Rails, including event ticketing,
        capital campaigns, data visualization dashboards, and a donor
        relationship manager.
