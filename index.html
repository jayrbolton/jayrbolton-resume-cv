            <p class='tj black-80'>
              KBase enables bench scientists to analyze research data and run bioinformatics workflows interactively. I work on core backend services in Python and Go, such as graph database APIs and the search engine. I also help to expand and document the bioinformatics SDK for third-party developers.
            </p>
            <p class='tj black-80'>
              In 2019, I received a lab recognition award for my work on the Relation Engine, which creates and queries large networks of biological data. I also regularly use high performance computing at NERSC to run large-scale genome sequence analysis.

              I helped plan and implement RallyStarter, a political advocacy platform. We set up a performant backend using Docker, Redis, MySQL, and AWS, along with a React frontend. For the Dat Project, I wrote encryption libraries and helped to write grant proposals.

            </div>
            <p class='tj black-80'>
              I was the technical co-founder for CommitChange and was responsible for building its web platform, hiring and managing the engineering team, and working directly with customers. We graduated from the BoostVC startup accelerator and received funding from Mark Cuban and Tim Draper. We processed over $25 million in donations on behalf of nonprofits.
            </p>
            <p class='tj black-80'>
              I worked closely with customers to build a range of nonprofit fundraising tools, including event ticketing, capital campaigns, data visualization dashboards, and a donor relationship manager.

              I worked as a computer science tutor, a system administrator of the Scientific Lab for Advanced Computing Research, and interned as a platform engineer for MerchantOS (now Lightspeed POS). I explored interests in functional programming, type theory, and assembly language.
